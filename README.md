# PSU_my_sokoban_2017

2 weeks long project

The goal of this project is to simulate a Sokoban, a type of transport puzzle, using the arrow keys to navigate the player 'P'
To win the player needs to push all the boxes 'X' on the holes 'O'

To compile:

make

To run:

./my_sokoban maps/any_map

Note: Back then i forgot to add winning and losing conditions so the game won't stop no matter what you will do (no worries it won't eat your memory up, just CTRL+C the prog when you feel like leaving)
